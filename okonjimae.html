                    Because of their appearance, long mane and rich tail, horses have always caused admiration,

                <h1 style="text-align: center;"> APPROACHING THE HORSE </h1>
                <p>
                    <br />
                    As we said, the first contact is more important.
                    <b>Approaching the horse must not be done suddenly</b> and that is one of the most important points
                    because the horse can get scared and react violently.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <br /> Before approaching the horse, we must "announce" ourselves with a sound or a gentle movement.
                    When we see that the horse has noticed us, you can approach it closer.
                    <strong> Always approach the horse from the left side!!!</strong> Pet the horse and give it a sign of friendship.
                    <br />Our horses are very trained and calm, so with instructions you can easily reach the interesting part -

                </p>
                <p>
                    <i></i>
                    By putting your left foot in the stirrup, you signal the horse to start climbing and to stand still.
                    <br />The next step is to grab the saddle. The left hand is by the saddle, which is closer to the horse's neck, and the right hand
                    the hand goes to the other end of the saddle.
                    You pull your body back, lean on your left leg and switch the right one.
                    WOOAA

                <p>
                    <strong> Did you know that based on the position and wagging of a horse's tail, you can determine its mood</strong>
                    <br /> Horses are very intelligent animals, any signal you give them correctly will be able to "read".

                    The breeder should get to know and understand the horse's individuality and thereby create a relationship of complete mutual trust.
                    When feeding horses, work calmly and quietly. Feeding the horse is the best time to notice injuries or other anomalies.
                    Horses need a certain amount of bulk food. Bulk food helps to maintain the animal's health, and if this
                    component of the meal is not provided, symptoms such as: tree bite, tail and mane bite, tree branch bite...
                    The best source is well-kept quality pasture.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Cleaning and bathing are not only hygienic, but also aesthetic procedures. Apart from the fact that you have freed the animal from the litter,
                    dirt, parasites, you give it shine. Also,
                    water treatments stimulate oxidative processes in the horse's body, which positively affects its well-being.
                    The horse should be completely bathed at least once a week, and the legs should be washed after every walk.<br />
                    Before <strong><i> bathing </i></strong> the animal must be tied so that it does not get away from you at the wrong time.
                    Make a small stream of water and start washing, moving from the hooves to the body.
                    Then go to the stomach, the neck, and then down to the tail.
                    Last but not least, throw a gentle stream of water over your face.
                    <strong><i> Cleaning </i></strong> is quick and thorough. The first is usually used in the morning when the horse is taken out of the stable for training.
                    Thorough cleansing removes dirt, dust, opens pores and is also a good massage that improves blood circulation.

                    <br />
                    There are different ways and types of riding, we will explain some of them and you can look at them in more detail
                    on the next page. <br /> Trot – it is a bit faster than walking, and more uncomfortable for riding.
                    It can often be a problem for the rider to overcome it, until he gets his balance.
                    The feeling when riding is as if the horse throws you out of the saddle when it kicks off with its hind legs.<br />
                    Gallop (canter) – the fastest movement and the one that riders love the most! Although it would seem a little strange, the gallop is next to the walk
                    also a movement in which the horse is more rested than tired, because of the very way in which it moves. In freedom, the horse will if
                    he should start at a gallop rather than a trot, because it is easier for him.

        <div>
            <p>
                How do we distinguish walk, trot and gallop? Simply, by the number of hooves hitting the ground. When a horse moves at a walk, we hear four
                separate hits on the ground, one after the other. While walking, only one leg is in the air, the other three are on the ground. When you put that down
                leg, lifts the next one and so on until all the legs are thin. In the trot, two hits on the ground are heard - the horse will land at the same moment
                put down for example the back right leg and the front left. After that, it will spend a moment in the air, then it will land on the ground
                the back left leg and the front right. In walk and trot, the arrangement of the legs is always the same. This is not the case with the gallop. As in humans
                we have left-handers and right-handers, in horses we have left-hooks and right-hooks, and thus we distinguish between left and right gallop. This has connections
                on which side the horse's muscles are more relaxed and it is easier for him to start that gallop. When we let a horse loose, it always will
                go at the gallop that is more natural to him. Arrangement of legs for the right gallop: the first one off the ground
                the rear left leg, when it goes down, the rear right and front left legs move at the same time,
                and when they descend, the front right leg moves. After this, the horse spends a moment in the air and the leg spacing is repeated.
